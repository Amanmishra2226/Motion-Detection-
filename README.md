# Motion-Detection-
This project implements a real-time motion detection system using Python and OpenCV. It is designed to monitor video streams from a camera, detect any movement within the frame, and highlight the moving objects. The system can be used for security surveillance, automated alerts, and activity monitoring.

Key Features:
Real-time motion detection using computer vision techniques.
Highlights moving objects with bounding boxes.
Captures and stores frames where motion is detected.
Configurable sensitivity to avoid false positives.
Lightweight and efficient for continuous monitoring.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and optionally Tkinter for GUI integration.

Use Cases:
Home and office security systems.
Automated surveillance monitoring.
Wildlife activity tracking.
Smart automation systems.
